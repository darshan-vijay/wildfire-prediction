#  Integrated Wildfire Risk Prediction and Monitoring System

A comprehensive wildfire prediction and monitoring framework built using multi-source data and advanced machine learning techniques. The system integrates real-time fire data, meteorological parameters, satellite imagery, and human activity data to assess fire risk and predict wildfire occurrences in regions like Queensland, Australia.
